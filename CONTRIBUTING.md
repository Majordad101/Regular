# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for taking a look at Regular!
It is hoped that these tools will be able to grow over time, with feedback from AEC/BIM data professionals around the globe.

## How You Can Help

* Bug Reports! Did Regular do something unexpected? Is this a behaviour you can reliably reproduce? We'd love to hear from you: Please raise a [Github issue](https://github.com/OliverEGreen/Regular/issues) if this is something you know how to do, otherwise feel free to message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Oliver_E_Green) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-green/).

## Areas for Improvement

I'm a self-taught programmer, so if you're into coding (particularly WPF) and would like to contribute, please feel free to create a pull request. 

In no particular order:
- The general XAML and UI structuring of Regular could use some tidying up.
- Regular is pretty fast, but it would be even better if we could increase the speed of validation.
- Regular generates some pretty ugly (but working!) Regular Expressions. We could possibly use further logic to clean these up, e.g. turning \d\d\d into \d{3}
